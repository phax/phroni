PH Reliable Object Notation Insight, a generic visualization library for electronic business documents.
Thanks to Elisabeth, Neele, Moritz and Thomas for helping coming up with this name.

The visualization of business documents is a tedious task, because it involves a lot of different parameterization and customizations in all areas of the process. Because the visualized document is often misunderstood as the original, even though it is "just" a different kind of display of an "original" that is present in a different structured, machine readable format only.
